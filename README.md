# Spreadsheet Format

| Name of Participant | Name of instituition                  | Event       | Position      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Chandler Bing       | Amity International School, sector-46 | MUN         | 1             |
| Joey Tribbiani      | Amity International School, sector-46 | Programming | 2             |
| Ross Geller         | Amity International School, sector-46 | Hackathon   | participation |

- Let's say a person - Ross Geller, has not achieved any position then its corresponding _Position_ column should have the word "participation" as the value (as can be seen in the above example.)
- The data entry should start from the first cell of the spreadsheet i.e A1.

# Usage
Primarily built for Amity International School, Gurgaon but feel free to use it for personal purposes as well. :smile:
